# LaserCast

Uploaded here upon my friends' requests. A simple program that captures a laser pointer via camera and draws lines in the output of a video projector.

Made for [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi), but it probably can be adapter for other [Linux distros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) and systems. However, we had to use [LXDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXDE) due to something about the asynchronicity in the frame buffer.

I can't add compile/run instructions because I don't have them, and I don't have neither the Pi nor a video projector nor a webcam, so I can't test it.

The comments are [Doxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen) style, but I didn't include the script to compile them because they use  [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) and I [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). Uses [OpenCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV), so all copyrights belong to their respective owners.
